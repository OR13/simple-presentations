# Simple Presentations

A proposal to use [vp-request-spec](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vp-request-spec/) with [universal-wallet-interop-spec](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec) to enable peer to peer data exchange using [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

## Alternatives

[DIF Presentation Exchange](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange)

This spec is overly complicated, we don't need to support any data model except for [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), so most of the spec's support for arbitrary data models and transports is not useful.
